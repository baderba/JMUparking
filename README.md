Problem Statement

College students are constantly putting things off until the last minute. From waiting until the day before a project is due to start it, to leaving for class at the last possible second. Students are always on a time crunch. By creating an app that allows JMU students to see how many parking spaces are available at each parking deck, students can manage their time even better. Before the user even gets in their car, they can open the app and quickly view their options. This means they can leave later, allowing them more time on the project they put off until the last minute. 


Social Context Analysis

By creating an app that helps people decide where they want to park before they leave their house, there are a couple possibilities of how society will be affected.  Port Republic Road and Reservoir Street are two of the most congested roads in Harrisonburg, consisting mostly of students from JMU.  By allowing students to have the option of knowing where to go before they leave, it could help alleviate some traffic, since people know exactly where they want to go.  Students won’t have to turn around if they find out a parking deck is full, because they’ll already know it’s full.  This means that everyone is able to save time driving, and could even help prevent potential car accidents.
This app could also go the other way, causing more traffic around the campus.  If all the users look at the app around the same time and all decide on going to the same parking deck, traffic could easily increase.  This means that people will have to spend more time in their vehicles and run a greater risk of being late to class, if you’re a student, or to your destination, if you’re a Harrisonburg native.  This could also mean more car accidents since there will be more traffic.
