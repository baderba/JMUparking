JMUparking
==========
College students are constantly putting things off until the last minute. From waiting until the day before a project is due to start it, to leaving for class at the last possible second. Students are always on a time crunch. By creating an app that allows JMU students to see how many parking spaces are available at each parking deck, students can manage their time even better. Before the user even gets in their car, they can open the app and quickly view their options. This means they can leave later, allowing them more time on the project they put off until the last minute.
